created a new branch locally (adding code $ git branch <branch name>) (to change bash from main to branch repo us "$ git checkout <branch name>)
a new txt file created in the branch locally (once bash is on branch repo added file by using "echo" code or "notepad" code for adding .txt file)
now to upload this file and branch online (uploaded the new locally made files and branch to remote repo use "git add" "git commit -m "comment"" & "git push")
and finally merge the branch and master (to merge first switch to main repo "git checkout main" then to merge branch use "git merge <branch name>"
